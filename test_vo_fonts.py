"""A voiceover reel gets its fonts the way every other build does, on a buyer's machine too.

THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. vo-build.py looked for a pack's fonts in the shipped style-packs.json and in
assets/fonts/ and nowhere else. The licensed faces are not bundled with the engine, so on a buyer's
machine the Playful pack found no caption font at all and stopped with "no usable font for pack Playful"
AFTER the whole picture had been rendered, a pack the buyer built herself (_local/style-packs.json) died on
a KeyError traceback, and Editorial's script takeover quietly turned into its caption font. Now it asks
product/stylepack.py, the resolver every other build uses (her own packs, the fonts she added in CapCut, and
the pack's own stand-in when a face is not on the machine), and it asks before the picture is built.

How it is checked: a throwaway engine with the real style packs and the bundled fonts, once with every font
present (the creator's machine: each pack must resolve to exactly its own files, as before) and once
without the faces that do not ship (a buyer's machine). HOME points at an empty folder, so no real CapCut
font library is ever read. No render: pack_fonts is called directly, plus one vo-build run that must stop
before its first step.

Run: python3 product/tests/test_vo_fonts.py
