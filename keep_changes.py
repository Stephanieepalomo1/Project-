"""keep_changes.py — an update keeps every change she made to the engine, and writes down what it did.

    python3 product/keep_changes.py          after an update: bring her changes forward (runs on its own)
    python3 product/keep_changes.py --scan   list every change she has made to the engine; writes nothing
(Windows: python, never python3.)

WHY THIS EXISTS. The creator's Claude changes the engine for her: a tweak to a builder, a rule added to
CLAUDE.md, a pack whose blue became blush pink. An update used to write the new version of every file it
carries straight over hers. It kept a backup, but nothing ever put her change back, so each update quietly
undid the work her Claude had done, and she found out when a reel came out wrong. An update carries every
file that has changed since the first release, which is nearly every file, so this happened on every update.

HOW. Every update now carries the originals: every version of every text file this engine ever shipped,
packed into one small archive (_updates/history/engine-originals.tar.xz, written by the updater like any
other file), plus the fingerprint of every file in every version. After the new files land, this step:
  1. reads the update's backup of every file it replaced or removed (her versions of them);
  2. asks of each one "is this exactly a version we shipped?" by fingerprint. If so, she never touched it;
  3. for each file she did change, finds the original she started from and re-applies her change on top of
     the new version: a three-way merge, the same idea git uses. Where her edit and ours touch different
     lines, her change comes back on its own. Where they collide, the new version stays in place, hers is
     saved, and the `update` skill has Claude bring it forward with her;
  4. a shipped style pack she edited in place comes back as her own pack ("My Butter") and becomes her
     default if it was; the packs she built are put back by post-update.py's pack step;
  5. CLAUDE.md is refreshed every update with her profile kept; any other line she or her Claude added is
     re-applied the same three-way way;
  6. writes it all down in _local/my-changes.md, newest update first, in plain words, with her saved copies
     and the exact change beside them under _local/my-changes/.

It runs from post-update.py, which ships INSIDE every update, so it works whatever updater version she has.
It never raises into the update: anything it cannot do, it reports and leaves alone. Everything it writes
over is still in the update's backup, and `apply-update.py --rollback` undoes the lot.
