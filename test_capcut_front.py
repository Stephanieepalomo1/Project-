"""test_capcut_front.py — the keep-on-top pass must be quiet when there is nothing to do.

capcut_front.ensure() runs every 30 seconds from its LaunchAgent. It used to rewrite CapCut's index, and leave
a timestamped backup of it, on EVERY run, even when the remembered drafts already led the list: one drafts
folder collected thousands of backups that way. And its CapCut check answered "not running" when the check
itself failed, which is the one answer that lets it write.

Everything here runs in a temp folder: the real index, the real pin list and the real CapCut are never touched.
Run: python3 product/tests/test_capcut_front.py
