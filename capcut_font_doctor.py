"""capcut_font_doctor.py — check that every style-pack font resolves, and hand-map any that don't.

The engine resolves each pack's fonts BY NAME from the buyer's own CapCut (CapCut Pro carries the licensed
display faces). Normally that "just works." This is the safety net for when it doesn't — a wrong CapCut
name, a font not added yet, a nonstandard install. It tells the buyer EXACTLY which font is missing and
gives two ways to fix it, then re-checks.

  python3 product/capcut_font_doctor.py                 # check every pack
  python3 product/capcut_font_doctor.py Playful         # check one pack
  python3 product/capcut_font_doctor.py --map "Ugly Dave=/path/to/UglyDave.otf"   # hand-map a font
  python3 product/capcut_font_doctor.py --unmap "Ugly Dave"                        # remove a hand-map

Resolution order for each pack font (first hit wins):
  1) a bundled OFL file we ship (assets/fonts/<file>) — machine-independent, always works
  2) a hand-map the buyer added here (font-overrides.json) — the manual escape hatch this tool writes
  3) the buyer's CapCut, by name (userFontData) — the normal path (CapCut Pro)
  4) CapCut's Library/Fonts by basename guess
  5) CapCut's in-app catalog cache — a font added via CapCut's text-panel search is cached by an opaque
     id, not by name, so its real family name is read out of the cached file (see capcut_userfonts)
A font that resolves anywhere = ✓. A font that resolves NOWHERE = ✗ and is reported with a fix.

The hand-map is written to product/creative-vault/font-overrides.json and is read by the engine's shared
resolver (capcut_userfonts.resolve_font_file) on every build, so a fix here fixes every format at once.
