"""pack_persist.py — keep a creator-built style pack alive across an engine update.

A pack the creator builds ("build my own style pack" / `/studio recipe`) is written INTO two shipped
files: `creative-vault/style-packs.json` and `pack_palettes.py` (see pack_write.py). Neither file is
protected by the updater, and neither is merged, so a routine "update me" replaced both and the pack was
gone — while `user-style.json` (which IS protected) still named it, so the next build asked for a pack
that no longer existed. Their look, deleted by a maintenance step they were told was safe.

The fix keeps the shipped files exactly as they are (every reader keeps working, nothing else changes) and
adds ONE protected sidecar that records what the creator built:

    product/creative-vault/user-packs.json
        {"packs": {"<name>": {"block": ..., "recipe": ..., "palette": ..., "system_fonts": ...}},
         "forgotten": ["<name>", ...]}

`block` is the pack's style-packs.json body, `palette` every pack_palettes.py entry filed under its name,
`recipe` the same six entries in the shape pack_write.apply() takes (None for a QUICK pack, which has no
palette of its own: fonts + accent only), and `system_fonts` the "SYSTEM:<key>" font paths it points at.
All of it is read out of the files verbatim, so restoring a pack is a replay of what was there — not a
second, drifting implementation, and never an invented colour.

  record()    pack_write calls this after a successful write.
  harvest()   records every pack in a tree that is not recorded yet — the quick ones included (they used to
              be skipped as "incomplete", and the next update deleted them). Run on the live files before an
              update overwrites anything, it also brings a record up to date with a pack she has since
              changed: before an update, the live files are the truth.
  restore()   replays recorded packs that the shipped files no longer have. Runs after an update.
  rescue()    after an update: the above, plus every pack still sitting in an update backup — so a pack an
              EARLIER update deleted, before any of this existed, comes back too.
  forget()    "delete my pack X" for good: it leaves both files and is never brought back from a backup.
  adopt_edited()  a SHIPPED pack she changed in place (Butter with her own colours) comes back as her own
              pack, "My Butter", instead of being quietly reset to the shipped one. Runs after an update
              (keep_changes.py), against shipped_history() of every version the engine shipped.

    python3 product/pack_persist.py recover     "restore my style pack": look everywhere, put back what is
                                                 missing, and say plainly what was found

Stdlib only, and every entry point is written so a damaged sidecar can never take a build (or an update)
down with it: on any unreadable state it reports and returns, it does not raise.
