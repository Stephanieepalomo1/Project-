vo-splice.py — rough-cut the VOICEOVER. Drop the deleted lines, splice the kept audio clean, apply the
register's PACING to the gaps between lines, and re-derive word timings. The VO parallel to the Yaps'
`stitch-cut.sh` — because the recording is never perfect.

  • --cut "3,5"      delete those transcript lines (1-based, matching the style-plan widget) — bad takes / filler
  • --pace punchy    TRIM the dead space between lines (tight, energetic)   [gap floor ~0.14s]
  • --pace emotional KEEP the breathing room (let each line land)           [natural pauses]

Reads   projects/<job>/audio/vo.*  +  projects/<job>/vo-grid.json
Writes  projects/<job>/audio/vo.clean.wav        (the spliced clean voiceover — the new spine)
        projects/<job>/vo-grid.clean.json        (re-timed words/phrases for the captions + cut grid)
vo-build.py prefers these `.clean` files when present.

Usage:
  uv run product/vo-splice.py --job my-reel --cut "3" --pace emotional
  uv run product/vo-splice.py --job my-reel --pace punchy          # no deletes, just tighten the gaps

    A phone voice memo lands anywhere from -38 LUFS (recorded across the room) to -16 (held close), and the
    VO path had no leveling at all, so a quiet memo shipped a reel nobody could hear. The Yap path uses a
    fixed +10 dB amplify, which only works because that mic sits at a known distance; a voiceover has no
    such guarantee. So the gain is MEASURED per take.

    Loudness alone is not enough, and chasing it is how this went wrong the first time. A take recorded
    across a quiet room has a big peak-to-loudness ratio, so dragging it to the -14 LUFS social norm drove
    true peak to -1 dBTP and left the whole programme redlining once a music bed sat on top. The gain is
    therefore the SMALLER of what loudness wants and what the peak ceiling allows, and the limiter is a
    safety net for stray transients rather than the thing doing the work. Still static: no compressor
    riding the level, so it cannot pump.
