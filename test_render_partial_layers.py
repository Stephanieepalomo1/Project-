"""test_render_partial_layers.py — a render of SOME of the reel's layers is judged on the elements it holds.

The render gate opens the finished file and refuses it when it is blank at a moment the caption-plan puts an
element on screen (test_render_proves_itself.py). It used to ask EVERY render for EVERY plan element. A
render of one layer (LAYER=captions / hook / takeover / elements for separate layers, the hook / front split
behind mode renders, a one-style caption overlay) never draws the other layers' elements, so a correct
render was refused: "the render is EMPTY where the plan says an element is on screen".

Now a plan time is asked of a render only when its composition holds a clip for that element (element i on
lane 7 + i, a breakaway card on lane 6, as build-reel-type.py lays them out). A full composition holds every
element, so it is judged exactly as before, and one that cannot be read with certainty (no index.html, a
sub-composition) still has every plan time checked.
