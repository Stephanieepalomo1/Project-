"""pack_palettes.py — the ONE source of truth for the locked per-pack palettes + treatments.

Imported by BOTH `hands_off_pack_to_design.py` (design.md generation) and `build-reel-type.py` (the render

GOVERNING RULE: these looks are THE house style for any HyperFrames MP4 render ABOVE raw (medium + well-done +
Hands-Off + Animation). Raw = native CapCut, untouched. TASTE RULE: the ground elevates · ONE accent per slide ·
multicolor is a RARE treatment · female-creator aesthetic, never kiddie · no WordArt shadows.

# ── CARD THEME (the THEME layer) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each pack's DISTINCT full-screen designed-card recipe — used by the breakaway (and, when built, Hands-Off /
# Animation full frames). This is the ONLY thing that differs per pack when the engine draws a card. The BUILD
# LOGIC that animates it (dissolve + push-in, staggered back.out reveals, accent-mark wipe, emphasis pop) and the
# caption-yield around it live ONCE in the engine and are IDENTICAL for every pack (your rule 2026-08-09: themes
# distinct, build consistent). NO fabricated brand: `monogram` is a slot that renders ONLY if a client supplies a
# real logo/monogram — never invent one to fill space.
#   structure  which card layout the engine draws ("editorial" = centered type + hairline rule · "block" =
#              bordered candy-block with a hard offset shadow · "minimal" = solid block-behind-word on dark ·
#              (Vintage discarded; role name only). Font ROLES resolve to the pack's loaded fonts in the engine
#              (headline/label/script/kicker), so the theme never hardcodes a font name.
