#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Three Windows failures that a Mac can never reproduce by running the engine, pinned as tests.

All three come from one tester's PC (v1.0.56 report) and all three had the same shape: the engine
looked for a thing in a place, the thing was somewhere else, and the engine reported "not installed"
instead of "not found where I looked". A Mac passes every one of these by accident, so without a test
they silently come back on the next refactor.

  1. VERSIONED TOOL DIRECTORIES. ffmpeg installs to WinGet/Packages/<pkg>/ffmpeg-<version>-full_build/bin
     and node unzips to Programs/node/node-v<version>-win-x64. No fixed string can match either, so the
     shim has to glob. It previously checked WinGet/Links (empty on that machine) and Programs/nodejs
     (one level too shallow), and found neither tool.

  2. THE python3 DECOY WITH NO FALLBACK. Windows ships an App Execution Alias at the name `python3`
     that exists on PATH and refuses to run. On that machine `python` and `py` were also absent, so all
     three of the shim's checks failed while a working interpreter sat at ~/.local/pyenv/Scripts.

  3. open() WITHOUT AN ENCODING. Python's open() uses the locale codepage on Windows, not UTF-8, so any
     file holding a curly quote or emoji raises UnicodeDecodeError. Setting PYTHONUTF8 fixes it only for
     processes launched through a shell script that exports it, which is not how most of these run.
     The call sites are the only place the fix holds everywhere.
