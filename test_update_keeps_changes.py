"""test_update_keeps_changes.py — an update keeps the changes she (or her Claude) made to the engine.

What used to happen: an update wrote the new version of every file it carries straight over hers, kept a
backup nobody would ever open, and her change was gone. A style pack built with "build my own style pack"
was written only into style-packs.json, never saved, and deleted. A shipped pack edited in place ("keep
Butter but make the blue pink") was silently reset. This builds a real OLD install with her edits in it,
applies a real update package through the real updater (one too old to know any of this, with no pack
protection at all), and checks each change came through, or was handed to her, and written down.
