"""make-handoff.py — turn a real-machine failure into a support report the buyer can email in.

Used by `scripts/smoke-test.sh` (a failed fresh-Mac validation) and by the `pc-conversion` skill. The whole point:
a report from a real machine is exactly what makes the engine bulletproof, so every major failure becomes a
message to the engine's support inbox instead of a dead end.

HOW IT SENDS: honestly and simply. It writes the report to a local file and shows the buyer the support
email address to send it to (plus a one-click "open my mail app" convenience). THE BUYER sends it — there
is no automatic/background upload, because a reliable auto-send is not something the environment can promise
(sending data out to an endpoint can be flagged or blocked, which would be a false sense of security). The
plain address ALWAYS works: they copy the file into an email to that address from whatever mail they use.

SUPPORT_EMAIL is the engine's support pointer, not brand identity — like the community name, it is kept
whole through packaging (see make-ship.sh protect/restore) so a buyer's report actually reaches the team.
