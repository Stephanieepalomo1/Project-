"""capcut_front.py — keep engine-built drafts at the TOP of CapCut's project list, permanently.

Her list is 150+ drafts deep. A new draft that lands in the middle of it is lost, and she should never have
to hunt for the thing she just asked for.

Doing this once at build time does not work, and that is the whole problem. CapCut orders the browser by
`tm_draft_modified` in `root_meta_info.json`, and it REWRITES that file from its own records every time it
runs — so a draft put at the top while CapCut was quit gets shuffled straight back down the next time she
opens the app. It has to be re-applied AFTER each CapCut session, which is not something a build step can do.

So the builders `remember` a draft, and `--ensure` re-applies it whenever CapCut is closed. A LaunchAgent can
run `--ensure` on a timer, which makes it automatic instead of something to ask for.

The agent is OPT-IN and nothing installs it for you: it only exists if `--install` is run by hand, and it
only ever acts while CapCut is CLOSED, so it cannot interfere with a session in progress. `--uninstall`
removes it completely.

  python3 product/capcut_front.py "<name>"          # bring one to the top now
  python3 product/capcut_front.py --remember "<name>"   # and keep it there from now on
  python3 product/capcut_front.py --ensure         # re-apply if CapCut is closed (the LaunchAgent calls this)
  python3 product/capcut_front.py --install        # install the LaunchAgent
  python3 product/capcut_front.py --uninstall      # remove it
  python3 product/capcut_front.py --list           # show the top of the list

CapCut must be QUIT for any write: anything written to its index while it is running is overwritten on its
next save. The index is her record of every draft she owns, so it is backed up before it is touched and no
other entry is ever modified.
