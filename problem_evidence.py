"""problem_evidence.py — the half of /report-a-problem that looks at what HAPPENED, not what is installed.

    python3 product/problem_evidence.py            # a few seconds: what ran, how far, what is running now
    python3 product/problem_evidence.py --render   # also the renderer's own checks and a timed test render
                                                   # (a few minutes; a 1-second test in a temp folder)
(On Windows: `python`, never `python3`, which can be the Microsoft Store decoy.)

WHY THIS EXISTS. scripts/collect-report.sh was built for setup: versions, paths, which tools are missing.
That answers "is this machine set up?", which is one kind of problem. Most of the others are "it did
something wrong": a render that ran all night, a build that says the engine is down, a finish that never
finished. For those, a list of installed versions comes back clean and says nothing, and a hardware
report says what the computer IS but not what it was DOING. What actually says something is the evidence
the engine leaves behind: how far the last render got and how fast (product/render_log.py), whether
anything is still running, how much memory is free right now, whether the build engine is up, and the
renderer's own health check. This collects that, and collect-report.sh folds it into the one report.

Report-only. Installs nothing, changes nothing, sends nothing, and touches no footage, transcripts or
captions. Only process NAMES are read, never what is in them. Every probe runs on a timer, and anything a
timer stops is stopped with its whole process tree, so a check can never leave a browser running.
Paths inside the engine are shown relative; the home folder becomes ~.
