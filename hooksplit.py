"""hooksplit.py — long hook -> headline + subhead (the split-hook pattern).

When a hook is long enough that a single headline would wrap to 3+ lines / climb out of the top safe zone,
splitting it into two BALANCED halves reads with more hierarchy than shrinking everything. Encoded from the
creator's two CapCut variations (2026-08-08):

  • The hook splits into two roughly length-balanced halves at a natural break (a conjunction: and/but/so...).
  • The EMPHASIS half renders in the pack HEADLINE font + size (the loud line).
  • The other half is a SUBHEAD in the pack CAPTION (or accent) font at ~caption size, but in the HOOK's
    CASE + color treatment (it is still the hook, not a read-along caption).
  • READING ORDER IS FIXED: the first half is always physically on top, the second below — the halves are
    NEVER reordered (the hook still has to read left-to-right, top-to-bottom). So the quiet line's position
    is NOT a free choice; it follows from which half carries the emphasis:
      - emphasis on the FIRST half  -> first half is the headline (top), second half is a SUBHEAD below it.
      - emphasis on the SECOND half -> first half is an EYEBROW (small line on top), second half is the
        headline below it.
    "Eyebrow" and "subhead" are the same quiet treatment (pack caption/accent font, hook case), named only by
    position. WHICH half is emphasized is the creator's call, made in the STYLE PLAN. This module does the
    mechanical split + reading-order-correct placement.
  • Placement groups the two as one unit in the upper safe zone (offsets below are from the pack headline y,
    calibrated to the creator's variations: gap ~0.16, headline near the pack y).

Per pack, the subhead font source defaults to the caption role; SUBHEAD_SRC overrides where the accent font
reads better as the quiet line.
