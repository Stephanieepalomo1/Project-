"""capcut_ripple.py — the ONE magnet/ripple enforcement, shared by every CapCut build.

the creator's hard rule (2026-08-02): "magnet ALL tracks AND audio to the main track. write that into
every capcut build here and on the shippable version." Overlays (img_/text), b-roll, AND audio must
all follow the main track's ripple trims — not just audio.

Single source of truth so it can never drift or be forgotten. Imported by cleanyap.py (Clean Yap +
the shipped kit), superyap.py (Super Yap), and patch-ripple-snap.py (surgical patch onto a live draft).
Kept in a neutral util module — neither the Clean Yap nor Super Yap lane depends on the other
. Call this LAST in finalize, AFTER per-track render_index is set
(z-order lives on each segment's render_index, so blanking track names never disturbs layering).

⚠️ THE ANCHOR RULE (root-caused 2026-08-12, magnet silently dead on a multi-segment cut):
The magnet needs an ANCHOR. In a native CapCut footage cut where the magnet works (verified against
real multi-segment cuts, 45+ segments), the MAIN footage track is `is_default_name=False` while every
OVERLAY track is `is_default_name=True`. `is_default_name=True` = an auto-named, identity-less "floating"
track. If the MAIN track is also `is_default_name=True`, CapCut has no anchor to adsorb to and NOTHING
ripples — even with `maintrack_adsorb=True` set. The old code set the main track to True, which silently
killed the magnet on every multi-segment cut. Main = False, overlays = True. Do not "simplify" this back.
`verify_maintrack_anchor()` below is the fail-safe that hard-stops a build if this regresses.

⚠️ THE TIMELINES RESET (root-caused 2026-08-17, "magnet not working" recurring every reel):
CapCut, on a draft's FIRST import, builds a native `Timelines/<id>/<draft json>` cache and RESETS the
main track's anchor to `is_default_name=True` there — killing the magnet — even though the top-level
the top-level draft JSON was written correctly. From then on CapCut runs off the Timelines copy, so the build-time
anchor is ignored. The fix cannot happen at build time (Timelines does not exist yet); it must be applied
AFTER the first open. `snap_draft_dir()` re-enforces the anchor into the top-level file AND every Timelines
copy; `verify_draft_dir()` is the fail-safe that checks EVERY copy (a broken Timelines copy is invisible in
the top-level file). Standard handoff: build -> open in CapCut -> quit -> snap_draft_dir -> reopen.
