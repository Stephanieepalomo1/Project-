"""The cut pipeline hands work between Python and shell through ONE scratch folder:
word-timings.sh writes it, transcript-cut.py drops cuts.json into it, stitch-cut.sh reads it back.

If the two sides compute that folder differently the handoff dies with "missing .../cuts.json",
and it dies SILENTLY on the happy path because each half looks correct on its own. That is exactly
what happened when the Windows pass moved the Python half to tempfile.gettempdir() and left the
shell half on a hardcoded /tmp: on macOS gettempdir() is /var/folders/.../T, not /tmp, so the two
halves stopped pointing at the same place on the SUPPORTED platform.

This test pins them together."""
