"""capcut_sfx.py — PORTABLE, shared SFX injector for every format. Ships self-contained.

the creator's ship rule (2026-08-02): "this all needs to be baked into the system. we can't be grabbing for my
assets on another user's macbook — it won't be there." So SFX are built ONLY from repo-bundled resources:
  • sound files → `product/creative-vault/sfx/*.mp3` (bundled, license note below)
  • audio-material structure → `product/creative-vault/caption-templates/audio-template.json` (captured once)
NO dependency on any other CapCut draft or the user's CapCut cache — works on a fresh buyer's machine.

⚠️ SFX LICENSING (parallels personal fonts vs ship fonts): the bundled files are the creator's CapCut favorites,
fine for HER reels; the SHIPPED kit needs a license-clear SFX pack (or per-style-pack SFX). Swap the files
in `creative-vault/sfx/`; the engine is source-agnostic. Rotate sounds so nothing repeats (see CLEANYAP.md).
