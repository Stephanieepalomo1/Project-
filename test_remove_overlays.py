"""test_remove_overlays.py — regression guard for finalize-proof overlay matching (Bug #6).

finalize's magnet (capcut_ripple.enforce_maintrack_ripple) blanks every non-main track's name to "", so
remove-overlays' old name-only match found nothing on any real (finalized) draft — it silently removed 0.
This proves the matcher removes a finalized overlay (name "" + flag==2 + material_name) while keeping the
footage track and unrelated overlays. Pure — no CapCut, no files. Run: python3 product/tests/test_remove_overlays.py
