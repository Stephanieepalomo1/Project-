"""settings_persist.py — keep the creator's own settings alive across an engine update.

Three things a creator sets up live INSIDE files the engine ships, and an update replaces those files
whole (measured on a real v1.0.93 -> v1.0.94 update: all three came back as the shipped defaults):

  * her permission mode, any other Claude Code setting she added, and any hook of her own, in
    `.claude/settings.json` (product/PERMISSIONS-SETUP.md tells her to put her mode there, and the engine's own
    hooks live in that file too)
  * her hook defaults: Part B of brand-kit.md writes DEFAULT_HOOK_TEXT / HOOK_END_WORDS into
    `presets/clean-captions/build.py`
  * her headline font: Part B swaps it into `presets/type-and-look.md` in place of the bundled Inter

Same shape of fix as pack_persist (her style packs): a protected record, `_local/kept-settings.json`,
written from the live files just before an update and replayed into the fresh files just after. Only her
part is ever written back: the engine's own hooks, and every line of a refreshed file she never touched,
arrive exactly as shipped.

  harvest(base=None)  read her values out of a tree (the live one, or an update backup's overwritten/ copy)
  restore()           put them back where the freshly shipped files have the default
  recover()           settings an EARLIER update replaced, found in the update backups. Report-only unless
                      asked, because a permission mode she has since turned off must never switch itself
                      back on:  python3 product/settings_persist.py recover [--apply]

Stdlib only. harvest/restore never raise: an unreadable file is reported, not fatal.
