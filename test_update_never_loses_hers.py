"""No update, however it goes, removes anything the buyer made. The release gate for that promise.

"Hers" is everything a creator sets up: the style packs she built (quick and recipe), a launch pack she changed in
place (it comes back as "My Butter"), her default pack and accent, what she taught the editor (learned preferences,
a named text animation), her favorites shelf and saved sounds, hand-mapped fonts, her brand kit and its Part B
edits (profile, look note, word list, hook defaults, headline font), her permission mode, a hook of her own in
.claude/settings.json, her local settings, keys, jobs, her own sound file, a hand edit to an engine builder, and a
line she added to CLAUDE.md. Each scenario below runs the REAL scripts/apply-update.py + post-update.py over a
fully customized install and compares all of it before and after:

  A  a normal update                             everything kept; nothing of hers "needs a hand" by mistake
  B  the updater killed partway (a power cut) at several points, then run again: everything kept
  C  the window closed / the app quit partway (SIGTERM, SIGHUP): the update puts itself back, then installs
  D  a killed update undone with --rollback instead: back exactly as she was, nothing of hers read from the
     half-replaced files
  E  --rollback after she built a pack, changed a pack and a setting, and edited an engine file SINCE the update:
     the packs and settings stay as she has them now, and the edited file is saved, never lost
  F  her .claude/settings.json was already broken: the update never writes an unreadable file, and hers is saved
  G  two updates in a row: everything survives both, her hooks and her My Butter are never doubled
  H  a buyer who changed nothing is not told she has changes
  I  the guards that keep this true for FUTURE releases: every hook the engine ships runs one of its registered
     hook scripts, every permission rule it ships is registered as the engine's, and every file an engine module
     keeps her things in is one the updater may never write
