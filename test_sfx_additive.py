"""test_sfx_additive.py — sound added to a draft she already has must leave her sounds alone.

capcut_sfx.add_sfx() replaces every 'sfx_' sound an earlier pass placed. That is right inside a builder's own
one-pass build (a rebuild never doubles its cues), and it was also the only mode there was, so the sound-design
skill's "additive only" pass quietly deleted the sounds already on the draft. keep_existing=True is the
additive mode; the default must stay exactly as it was for every builder that calls it.

Works in a temp folder only. Run: python3 product/tests/test_sfx_additive.py
