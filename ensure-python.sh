#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The updater (scripts/apply-update.py) is written in Python, and a brand-new Mac has no
# Python: /usr/bin/python3 is Apple's placeholder, which opens the "install the developer tools?" dialog
# instead of running. So on a fresh machine "update me" could never run, and the ONE fix a stuck machine
# needed (a setup route for its chip) was sitting on the update feed with no way to reach it. Measured on a
# tester's fresh Intel Mac, 2026-09-18: two rounds of instructions, a dialog nobody asked for, no update.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. Finds a working Python the way every engine script does (scripts/_python3-shim.sh), and when
# there is none, installs a private one through uv: uv's own installer lands in ~/.local/bin, then
# `uv python install 3.11 --default` puts a real python3 beside it. No Homebrew, no Apple developer
# tools, no password, no admin account, about two minutes, and it is the same interpreter the Intel-Mac
# setup route installs anyway (product/INTEL-MAC-ROUTE.md), so nothing is installed twice later.
#
# stdout carries ONLY the interpreter path (so it can be captured); every message goes to stderr.
# Exit codes: 0 found or installed · 3 none and --check/ENGINE_NO_BOOTSTRAP=1 · 4 uv could not be
# installed · 5 Python could not be installed.
