"""cut_placement.py — lays a cut onto a CapCut draft's main track the way the creator set it.

A cut is normally just in and out points on the raw clips. A cut pulled back out of her own CapCut timeline
(the your-turn round trip) can also carry what she set on each clip there, and the rebuild must reproduce it
exactly, not approximately:

  "speed"           the clip's playback speed (it plays (end - start) / speed long)
  "scale", "x", "y" her zoom and framing, in CapCut's own units (x/y are half-canvas, y up)
  "audio_detached"  she split the clip's sound onto its own audio clip, so the clip itself is silent

and the plan carries "audio_overlays": [{clip, start, end, target_start, volume}], the audio clips she laid
on the audio track (a split-off sound, a lead-in under the clip before). Every other cut has none of these
keys, and for it nothing changes. Shared by every Yap builder so the formats cannot drift apart.
