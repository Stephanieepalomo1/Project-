"""remove-overlays.py — remove named OVERLAY video tracks from the migrated CapCut draft (both the root
and the Timelines/* copies), so we can re-inject fresh caption/intro layers. CapCut MUST be quit.

Usage:
    CAPCUT_DRAFT="<draft folder name>" python3 remove-overlays.py [track ...]

    CAPCUT_DRAFT is REQUIRED (the CapCut draft folder under
    ~/Movies/CapCut/User Data/Projects/com.lveditor.draft). There is NO default draft — a missing or
    unknown draft is a hard error, never a silent no-op (a silent default could modify the WRONG project).
    Positional args = the overlay track names to remove; with none given, the standard injected set
    (cap-single cap-build cap-takeover intro-kinetic) is used and echoed so it is never silent.

Matching is finalize-proof: finalize's magnet blanks every non-main track name to "", so besides the track
name we also match a PIP overlay by flag==2 + its material_name (which build-overlay stamps and the magnet
never clears). Name-only matching silently removed 0 on any finalized draft (Bug #6).
