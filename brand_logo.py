"""brand_logo.py — resolve a REAL third-party brand's official mark + real color, live, at build
time. For a card/graphic that names or depicts an actual outside brand (an app, a platform, a
tool) — the "borrowed palette" exception in CLAUDE.md's Rules: that one element gets the brand's
own real color, sampled from the actual asset, never guessed from memory or forced into the
buyer's style pack.

NOTHING IS BUNDLED OR REDISTRIBUTED. Every mark is fetched live from a public source at the moment
a build actually needs it — the same pattern as a CDN dependency, not a stock-asset library shipped
inside the product. This sidesteps the redistribution question entirely: nothing of a third party's
ships in the buyer's copy of the engine, a specific brand's mark is pulled fresh only when a build
specifically asks for it.

Cascade (each tier tried in order; first hit wins):
  1. simple-icons — an open-source (CC0-licensed icon set) MIT-licensed project's monochrome
     official brand glyphs, served from a pinned jsDelivr CDN build for determinism. Covers
     thousands of consumer/tech brands. Also the SOURCE of the official brand hex color — simple-
     icons ships each icon's real brand color as data, which is exactly what "sampled from the
     actual asset, never guessed" needs.
  2. favicon fallback — any domain's own favicon via a public favicon service, for a brand simple-
     icons doesn't cover. Lower quality (a small raster icon, no color data), but universal: works
     for literally any domain name.
  3. miss — plain failure, said out loud. Never fabricate a placeholder logo or a guessed color.

Usage:
  python3 product/brand_logo.py instagram --out /tmp/instagram.svg
      → downloads the mark, prints its official hex color
  python3 product/brand_logo.py somenichetool --out /tmp/x.png
      → simple-icons miss, falls back to a favicon
