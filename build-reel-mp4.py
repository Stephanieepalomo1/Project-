"""build-reel-mp4.py — the FINISH step of the well-done (Route A) lane: bake the base cut + the
transparent type overlay + zoom punch-ins + matched SFX into ONE deliverable MP4.

  JOB=my-reel STYLE_PACK=Editorial OVERLAY=renders/xxx.mov python3 product/build-reel-mp4.py

Optional, only when the creator asks for a look by name (never a default):
  GRADE=cinematic|warm|cool|film|mono   grades the FOOTAGE only; the type overlay stays untouched

Everything is declared in projects/<JOB>/caption-plan.json so the build is reproducible from the
written spec (nothing lives only in a shell command):

  "punch":  {"scale": 1.10, "windows": [[4.33, 6.10], ...]}   zoom punch-INs (scale UP only, hard cuts)
            optional "anchors": [[0.62, 0.41], ...]           one face anchor per window, 0..1 of the
            frame. Left out, the anchors are measured from the footage (face-anchors.json); a punch
            that cannot be measured stays centred and says so. NEVER silently centre-anchor a zoom:
            an off-centre creator drifts toward the edge on every push-in.
  "sfx":    [{"file": "woosh.mp3", "at": 50.78, "gain_db": -12, "trim": 0.39}, ...]

Punch-ins are done as an overlay of a pre-scaled copy gated by `enable`, NOT zoompan: hard cuts are
what a punch-in IS, and this keeps one clean scale per window instead of resampling every frame.

SFX are summed at unity (normalize=0) and the whole mix goes through ONE limiter, so a cue can never
push the already-mastered voice track over 0 dBFS. Everything is trimmed to its motion length by the
caller (sound voices the movement: it starts and stops with the animation).
