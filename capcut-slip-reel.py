"""capcut-slip-reel.py — hand a whole reel to CapCut with every shot as a COMPOUND, so she can slip.

CapCut ships no slip tool: once a shot is placed you cannot change which part of the source plays without
dragging its edges, which shifts everything after it. This builds the reel so each beat is a compound clip
holding its WHOLE source, with only the chosen window on the timeline. Double-click into a compound, drag
the clip inside, and the beat keeps its position and length while a different moment plays. That is a slip,
and it is hers to do by hand — no round trip through the engine.

  product/engine/VectCutAPI/venv-capcut/bin/python product/capcut-slip-reel.py \
      --job my-reel --name "my-reel slip" \
      --plan shot-plan.capcut.json --graphics demos/graphics.mov

Run it with the VectCut venv python, and with CapCut QUIT.

Layout of the draft she gets:
  · the voiceover as ONE unbroken audio track, so nothing she does to the picture can pull it out of sync
  · every beat above it as a compound, each holding its full source clip
  · optionally the finished graphics as one overlay layer on its own track, timed to the VOICE rather than
    to the picture, so slipping a shot never moves a caption

Compound format: see product/capcut_compound.py (decoded from a compound the creator built by hand).
