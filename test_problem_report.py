"""test_problem_report.py — /report-a-problem has to answer "what was it DOING", not just "what is installed".

The case this exists for: a buyer's well-done render was still going the next morning, so it was cancelled,
and nothing on her machine could say what it had been doing. The render timing file is only written when a
render ENDS, the stall report only when the renderer goes silent, and the problem report only listed
versions and paths, which all came back clean. So support could only guess, and the report tool was, in
practice, a setup checker.

What this pins down:
  1. A render that is stopped mid-way still leaves a record saying how far it got and how fast.
  2. The record tells the three failure shapes apart: FROZE (renderer silent while the engine waited),
     CRAWLED (frames still counting, slowly), and STOPPED from outside (record no longer rewritten).
  3. Two renders alive at the same time are called out, because that alone turns minutes into hours.
  4. A step that prints nothing by design (the ffmpeg bake) is never mistaken for one that never started.
  5. The real render wrapper (reel_render._run_render_watched) writes that record from the renderer's
     own progress output, and marks the result.
  6. The evidence script runs, and the collector folds it into the one report, before "What happened".
