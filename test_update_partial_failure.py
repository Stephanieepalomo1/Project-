"""An update that fails partway must never leave a half-updated engine.

What used to happen: each file's checksum was checked only as it was written, and product.json (it sorts
before product/) was written near the start. A bad file, a full disk or a read-only folder midway stopped the
update with every file before it already new: the engine read as updated, "update me" answered "already up to
date", and --rollback (which only reads a finished update's applied.json) undid the update BEFORE it instead,
leaving a mix of three versions.

This runs the real scripts/apply-update.py in a throwaway engine and pins:
  1. a bad checksum on a file that sorts after product.json: caught before anything is written
  2. an error midway (a folder the update cannot write into): everything goes back on its own
  3. the process killed partway: product.json is still old, and --rollback undoes exactly this update
  4. the automatic put-back itself failing: the message says so and the rollback command it prints works
  5. a normal update: the record --rollback reads is exactly what it always was
