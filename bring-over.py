    python3 scripts/bring-over.py "<old engine folder>" --apply --projects
                                                                   bring her footage even where it is a full
                                                                   copy (a PC, or another drive): asked first
    python3 scripts/bring-over.py --find                           list the engine folders in her home folder
(Windows: python, never python3.) Run it from THIS engine's folder, the new one. The `bring-over` skill
drives it: preview first, her yes, then --apply.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A new major version arrives as a fresh download, not as an update, so nothing she made in
the old folder is in the new one: her brand kit, her creator profile, the style packs she built, what she
taught it, her favorite sounds, her words, her settings, her keys, her reels. This brings all of it across,
and none of the old engine's own files, so the new version stays exactly the new version.

WHAT COMES ACROSS. Every item is COPIED. The old folder is only ever read: CapCut drafts built there still
point at footage inside it, so it has to keep working until those reels are finished.
  brand-kit.md                  hers, the whole file (while this engine's is still the blank one)
  CLAUDE.md                     her creator profile and look note, dropped into the NEW instructions with
                                merge-claude-md.py's merge(); any other line she added is saved and handed
                                to her, never merged blind
  style packs                   every pack she built: from the old pack files, from the old protected copy
                                and from every old update backup (so a pack an EARLIER update deleted comes
                                back too), written in through pack_persist / pack_write so this engine's
                                protected copy records them. The engine's own packs never come across; one of
                                them she changed in place comes across as a pack of her own ("My Butter")
  user-style.json               her default pack and accent, once that pack exists here
  _local/                       everything she taught it, minus caches and markers
  user-effects, font-overrides  the text animations she named and the fonts she matched up by hand
  caption words                 merged by the updater's own rule: new defaults arrive, her words win
  settings in engine files      permission mode, hook defaults, headline font: settings_persist harvests
                                them from the old files and restores them into these
  keys and connections          .env, .mcp.json, config.json, .claude/settings.local.json (values never shown)
  projects/ and inbox/          copied as copy-on-write clones where the disk offers them. Where it cannot
                                (a PC, another drive), the copy is a full duplicate of her footage, so
                                --apply stops before copying anything until she picks --projects or
                                --no-projects
  files she added               in assets/, the sound folder and presets/; any other one is listed for her

WHAT NEVER HAPPENS. Nothing is written in the old folder. Nothing in this engine is overwritten except the
merges named above. Nothing is deleted anywhere. A change she made to one of the old engine's OWN files is
never copied over the new file: her copy is saved under _local/my-changes/from-v1/ and listed under "Needs a
hand" in _local/my-changes.md, where the update skill's "bring my changes forward" picks it up with her.

HOW OLD FILES ARE TOLD APART. product/templates/v1-history.json holds fingerprints of every v1 release:
hashed paths, hashed contents, and (hashed old path -> new path) for the files this version renamed. No v1
file name is in it, or in this script. An old file whose path and content both match is the engine's own;
a known path with other content is a change she made; a path v1 never shipped is hers.

Running it twice brings nothing twice. Stdlib only: it has to run before this engine is set up.
