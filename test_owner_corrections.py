"""Words that belong to whoever owns an engine stay out of the table every buyer receives.

presets/caption-corrections.json ships to every buyer, and it had been carrying one owner's personal
flag words. Those now live in _local/caption-corrections.json, which the ship build leaves out and no
update touches, and the two tools that read the table lay it over the shared one:

  kept-words.py   applies its fixes and flags, between the shared table and the job's own file
  flag-words.py     counts its words as already handled, so they are not raised as suspects

So an engine that has the file behaves exactly as it did when those words sat in the shared table, and
an engine without it (every buyer's) simply never hears of them.
