"""text_effects.py — the SHARED named text-animation vocabulary for every rendered
overlay (.mov) and baked reel (.mp4). One place that turns an effect NAME into the
GSAP timeline lines the HyperFrames compositions run, so the rendered builders stop
hardcoding a single fade+rise and can name any of the catalog's effects per element.

Used by build-reel-type.py (hook, takeover) and build-hf-captions.py (takeover); any
composition can adopt it. It does NOT touch the CapCut editable-text path — this is
rendered-output motion only (the one place baking costs no editability).

The 24 IDs are the animate-text vocabulary carried by the hyperframes-animation skill
(per-character / per-word / per-line / whole-element). The EXACT frame specs live in
the upstream `/animate-text` skill, which is not vendored (licensing); this module is
the shippable GSAP-from-name implementation (the sanctioned fallback). For a personal
reel you can load `/animate-text` and hand-tune timings; the engine ships these.

Per-reel control: caption-plan.json
  "effects": {"hook": "focus-blur-resolve", "takeover": "bottom-up-letters"}
Any role left out uses DEFAULTS below. Pin the old look with "rise". "snap"/"karaoke"
are no-op sentinels (the builder keeps its locked behavior for those).

API
  resolve(caption_plan, role)          -> effect id (plan override else DEFAULTS)
