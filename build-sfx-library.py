"""build-sfx-library.py — regenerate the effects library's sound pool from creative-vault/sfx/sfx-index.json.

Why this exists: the wall's sound list is GENERATED from the index, and for a while nothing regenerated it.
The library underneath was replaced, the page went on advertising 230 sounds that no longer existed, and
every play button pointed at a deleted file while the click handler swallowed the error -- so a buyer
pressed play and simply nothing happened. The page is only ever as true as its last regeneration, so this
makes regenerating it one command, and --check makes "is it stale?" answerable without guessing.

The index is the source of truth. A cue is shown when it is ENABLED (`"enabled": false` hides one) and is
not an alias. Cues are grouped by MOOD, in the emotional order the wall reads in, not alphabetically.

    python3 product/build-sfx-library.py            rewrite the block in product/effects-library.html
    python3 product/build-sfx-library.py --check    say whether the page is stale; write nothing
