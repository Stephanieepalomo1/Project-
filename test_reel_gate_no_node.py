"""With Node missing, the pre-render gate says so, instead of blaming the composition or crashing.

On Windows the check runs as `cmd /c npx ...`. `cmd` always exists, so a missing npx never raised: it came back
as an ordinary exit 1 and the gate told her to "fix the composition". On a Mac the same case was a traceback.
The gate now asks for npx first (npx.cmd on Windows, which is what `cmd /c npx` runs) and says plainly that
Node is missing or the terminal needs reopening, with exit 4, the code reel_render.py uses for it.

Run: python3 product/tests/test_reel_gate_no_node.py
