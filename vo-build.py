vo-build.py — the VOICEOVER REEL BUILDER. One command: VO + b-roll + a shot plan -> finished reel.

This is the "make my voiceover reel" engine. It takes the pieces the rest of the pipeline produced and
assembles the reel in ONE pass (Route A, baked MP4):
  • reframes each chosen b-roll window to 9:16 1080x1920 (scale + center-crop)
  • opens with a gentle hook-burst, then holds one shot per phrase (from the shot plan), each hold
    carrying a gentle Ken Burns move by default (alternating push-in/out; --motion still locks them)
  • lays the VO as the continuous spine + a quiet music bed under it
  • renders captions from the VO's real word timings: KARAOKE BUILD (words appear as spoken, current word
    highlighted) + one full-screen TAKEOVER for the payoff line
  • fonts + case come from the chosen STYLE PACK; accent is the buyer's color OR none (all white)

Ken Burns push-in/out on holds is DEFAULT ON (the format's motion look; --motion still to lock).
NO color grade, NO deflicker, NO hook card, NO fades — locked per the format spec (grade is offered per reel).

Inputs (in projects/<job>/):
  audio/vo.*              the voiceover  (spine)
  vo-grid.json            from vo-cutgrid.py  (words + phrases + timings)
  shot-plan.json          the beat->shot plan (authored after reading broll-candidates.jpg):
      { "burst_stab": 0.5,
        "burst":  [{"path": "...", "in": 34.0}, ...],
        "holds":  [{"path": "...", "in": 14.0, "out": 15.9}, ...],   # in timeline order
        "takeover_from_phrase": -1 }                                  # which phrase is the takeover (default last)

Usage:
  uv run product/vo-build.py --job my-reel --pack Editorial --accent 5B8DEF
  uv run product/vo-build.py --job my-reel --pack Butter --accent none --music path/to/bed.mp3
