apply-update.py — safely apply an update package to this engine.

This ships INSIDE the buyer's product. When the creator releases a fix, the
buyer drops the small update file into their project folder and says
"update me" in Claude Code. The update skill runs this script.

What it guarantees:
  * It only ever writes files the update package explicitly lists.
  * It NEVER touches personalized / identity / secret files (hard denylist),
    even if an update package tries to. Their voice, brand kit, keys, config,
    research, and work are untouchable.
  * What is theirs INSIDE files it does replace (style packs they built, their
    permission mode, the hook defaults and headline font their brand kit set) is
    saved first and put back after (product/pack_persist.py, settings_persist.py),
    and a file of theirs at a path the engine stops shipping is left where it is.
  * Every file it overwrites or deletes is backed up first, so any update is
    reversible with `--rollback`.
  * It checks every file in the package before it changes anything, and writes
    product.json (the installed version) last. An update that stops partway puts
    back what it changed, or, if even that cannot finish, leaves `--rollback`
    able to: an engine is never left half-updated and reported as done.
  * An update that was stopped from outside (the window closed, the app quit, the
    power went) is put back the moment the next update or `--rollback` starts,
    before either reads a single file of hers: saving her settings from files an
    update had half replaced is how a stopped update used to lose them.
  * `--rollback` keeps what she made AFTER the update: her packs and settings as
    they are now are replayed into the older files, and any engine file she
    changed since the update is saved under _local/my-changes/ before the older
    copy goes back. CLAUDE.md gets the earlier version's engine instructions
    back too, her profile untouched and any line she added since carried over.
  * It refuses to write anywhere outside this project folder.

Usage (normally invoked by the `update` skill, but safe to run by hand):
  python3 scripts/apply-update.py               apply an update: check online first, else a local file
  python3 scripts/apply-update.py --fetch        check the creator's update server and apply if newer
  python3 scripts/apply-update.py [PACKAGE]      apply a specific local update folder/.zip
  python3 scripts/apply-update.py --check [PKG]  dry run: show what WOULD change, write nothing
  python3 scripts/apply-update.py --rollback     undo the most recent update
  python3 scripts/apply-update.py --version      print the installed version

PACKAGE may be a folder or a .zip. If omitted, the script first checks online
(when the product has an `update_url`), then looks for a package in the project
root and in an `_updates/` drop folder.

No third-party dependencies (online check uses only the Python standard library).
