"""The CapCut-must-be-quit guard must never pass because it FAILED to look.

Writing to a draft while CapCut has it open is silently discarded on CapCut's next save, which is how a
creator's hand edits disappear. capcut_running() used to answer False whenever the underlying process
check errored, and False means "go ahead and write" — so on any machine where pgrep or tasklist was
missing or blocked, the safety net quietly reported all clear.

Same failure shape as a verifier that passes having checked nothing. "I could not tell" is now its own
answer (None) and every caller treats it as unsafe."""
