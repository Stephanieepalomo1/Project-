"""Regression guard: text stuck past the edge of the video stops the render.

The bug this locks down: HyperFrames reports text past the frame edge as a `canvas_overflow` WARNING, and a
warning passes the check, so the gate printed "safe to render" over a takeover word running 207px off the
right edge and the render would have shipped it cut off. reel_render.py and reel_gate.py now refuse on it.

What must hold: a lasting overflow (⚠) is caught, once per element at its furthest; a word only sliding
through the edge as it animates in (ℹ) is not; the other warning kinds are not; and the message names the
word, the edge and the way out. Uses the check's real output format, no browser.

Run: python3 product/tests/test_offframe_text.py
