"""merge-claude-md.py — refresh the engine's own instructions in CLAUDE.md, keeping the creator's profile.

Why this exists: CLAUDE.md is protected from updates because it holds the creator's applied brand kit
(identity, niche, voice). That protection also meant every improvement to the ENGINE's instructions in
that file (pipeline steps, layout rules, what is optional, how setup works) never reached an existing
install. The code arrived; the instructions Claude reads stayed old.

How it works: the shipped, blank engine template lives at product/templates/CLAUDE.engine.md (the same
file a fresh install gets as CLAUDE.md). The creator's own content lives in the regions listed in BLOCKS
below — the profile block ("### Applied" down to "**⚠️ ASK THE REGISTER"), and the look banner ("**🎨 LOOK
IS", one paragraph) that records which style pack is live. This script takes the template and drops each
of those regions into it, so the result is "new instructions + her own content". The previous CLAUDE.md is
backed up first, always.

Why the look banner is in that list: it is set during onboarding, it sits outside the profile block, and
an update that refreshed the template used to revert it to "LOOK IS NOT SET YET" with nothing said. A
creator would not notice until a reel came out in the starter colors. Everything outside these regions is
engine instructions and is meant to be refreshed. When a new piece of creator-owned content is added to
CLAUDE.md, it belongs in BLOCKS on the same day, or the next update will quietly undo it.

Runs automatically at the end of every update (scripts/apply-update.py) and can be run by hand:
  python3 scripts/merge-claude-md.py            refresh if the template is newer
  python3 scripts/merge-claude-md.py --check    say what would happen, write nothing
Safe to run any number of times: when nothing would change, it changes nothing.
