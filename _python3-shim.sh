# _python3-shim.sh — source this before any `python3` call in a shell script.
#
# WHY: Windows ships a DECOY at the name `python3`. It is a Microsoft Store "App Execution Alias":
# it sits on PATH, so `command -v python3` and `[ -x ]` both SUCCEED, but running it does nothing
# except print "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store..."
# and exit non-zero. So a stock Windows machine LOOKS like it has python3 and does not.
# On Windows the real interpreter is normally called `python` (or is reached via the `py` launcher).
#
# This defines a `python3` shell function pointing at whatever actually executes, ONLY when the real
# `python3` does not work. On macOS/Linux the first test succeeds and nothing is defined — no-op.
#
# Detection is "does it RUN", never "does it exist" — existence is exactly what the decoy fakes.

# macOS: /usr/bin/python3 exists on every Mac, but without Apple's Command Line Tools it is only a
# PLACEHOLDER. Executing it does not run Python: it opens the "would you like to install the developer
# tools?" dialog over her screen and exits 1. Measured on a tester's fresh Intel Mac (2026-09-18): the
# updater's own "does python3 run" test popped that dialog, the update never ran, and the setup route
# her chip needed stayed out of reach. So the placeholder is never EXECUTED to find out. It is recognised
# by path plus `xcode-select -p`, which answers whether the tools are installed without touching anything.
# (When the tools ARE installed, /usr/bin/python3 is a real Python and passes the run test below.)
_P3_APPLE_PY="${_P3_APPLE_PY:-/usr/bin/python3}"   # overridable so a test can stand in a fake placeholder
_P3_SYS_ROOT="${_P3_SYS_ROOT:-}"                    # tests only: prefix for the system-wide Mac candidates below

  [ "$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null)" = "$_P3_APPLE_PY" ] || return 1
  xcode-select -p >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 1
  return 0
}

# Last resort when NOTHING on PATH runs: find a real interpreter on disk.
#
# WHY: measured on a tester's PC, `python3` was the Store decoy, `python` was not on PATH at all, and
# `py` was absent — so all three checks below failed and the engine had no interpreter, even though a
# perfectly good one sat at ~/.local/pyenv/Scripts/python.exe. She had to add it to PATH by hand every
# single session. A second tester's machine added two more: uv, which is how setup installs Python on
# Windows, keeps it under AppData/Roaming/uv/python/cpython-<ver>-windows-x86_64-none/, and drops a
# versioned python3.12.exe into ~/.local/bin rather than a plain python3. Neither was on this list, so the
# engine could not find the very Python its own setup had installed. These are the real directories Windows
# Python installers actually use; each is
# EXECUTED before being accepted, because existence is exactly what the decoy fakes.
#
# The Mac entries come first and are the mirror image of the same lesson: a fresh Mac's only python3 is
# Apple's placeholder (above), while a REAL one may sit in ~/.local/bin (uv's `--default` shim, which is
# what this engine's own Intel route and scripts/ensure-python.sh install), under uv's managed tree,
# in Homebrew's bin, or where python.org's installer puts it. /usr/bin/python3 is deliberately NOT in
# this list: when it works it already passed the PATH test, and when it does not, running it is the bug.

# macOS: on a very new macOS release, a Homebrew python's pyexpat module can link against the SYSTEM
# libexpat and expect symbols that copy does not have. Reported by a tester on macOS 26.2 + Homebrew
# python 3.14.7: `Symbol not found: _XML_SetAllocTrackerActivationThreshold`. That breaks `import
# plistlib`, and plistlib is underneath venv creation, ensurepip and pip, so setup dies with a confusing
# `ensurepip returned non-zero exit status 1` that names neither expat nor plistlib. Worse, it fails
# QUIETLY first: platform.mac_ver() returns ('', ('','',''), '') instead of raising, so pip's vendored
# truststore blows up on `int('')` and sends you chasing the wrong thing entirely.
#
# Fix: if Homebrew's own expat keg is installed, prefer it. The keg is keg-only, so it is never on the
# default search path and has to be named explicitly. Guarded to Darwin AND to the keg actually being
# present, so this is a no-op on every machine where the stock setup already works.

# scratch_root — the ONE scratch directory both halves of the engine agree on.

# WHY: the cut pipeline hands work between the two halves through a scratch folder. The Python half

# and those are the same folder, so the split was invisible. On Windows Git Bash they are two
# different real directories: Python answers C:\Users\<her>\AppData\Local\Temp while the shell falls
# back to /tmp, which Git Bash maps inside its own install. One half then writes files the other half
# cannot find, and it fails far downstream as a missing cuts.json rather than at the cause.
#
# So there is now one source of truth: ask Python, the same call the Python half makes, and convert
# the answer to the POSIX form this shell needs. The old expression remains only as a last resort for
# a machine where Python cannot be reached at all.
