"""stitch-cut.sh must fail loudly, never hand over a cut it did not make, and never save a stale plan.

Every case below shipped as a quiet success:

  1. BOTH ENCODERS FAIL, NOTHING WRITTEN. The integrity check looked at whatever sat at the output path,
     so the PREVIOUS run's cut passed it: "✓ software-encoder fallback produced a clean render", exit 0.
  2. VOICE_GAIN_DB SET BUT EMPTY. The toggles line said VOICE_GAIN_DB=10 while the graph said "volume=dB",
     which ffmpeg refuses (and then case 1 took over).
  3. RENDER=0 WITH A PLAN THAT CANNOT BE BUILT. The failure was swallowed, and a snapped EDL left in the
     scratch folder by an earlier run was saved over the job's cut, exit 0.
  4. THE SCRATCH PLAN IS GONE (the OS clears that folder). The run died with "missing", although the
     job's saved plan was right there; now it stitches that one and says so.
  5. A NON-HARDWARE FAILURE (a clip that is not there) was reported as "render failed the integrity
     check" and filed a hardware report. Only exit 3 means that.
  6. A JOB WITH SEVERAL CLIPS printed "quick-restart pass CRASHED" on every splice; the pass simply reads
     one-clip jobs only, and now splice says so plainly.
  7. The restart pass's ⚠ lines (re-listen here) were thrown away on success; now they are passed on.

It runs stitch-cut.sh from a throwaway copy of the engine with a short generated clip, so nothing real is
touched, and the hardware-report tool is a stand-in that only records that it was called.
