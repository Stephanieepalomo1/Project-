"""make-edit-timeline.py — generate a CORRECT edit-timeline.json for the COMMON case.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  build-hf-captions.py (the kinetic-caption engine) reads projects/<job>/edit-timeline.json to
  learn where every spoken word lands on the FINAL-CUT timeline. The only other writer of
  edit-timeline.json was a spoken-hook-excision tool (prep-reel.py, not part of the shipped engine)
  whose first step UNCONDITIONALLY DELETES the first clip on the main track, so on a normal job it
  would silently drop the real opening line. And a normal rough cut (the `rough-cut` skill path)
  never produces edit-timeline.json at all — it produces transcript/cuts.json and the derived
  outputs/<job>.transcript.json. So the caption path was effectively broken for a normal cut.

  This generator closes that gap: it builds a CORRECT edit-timeline.json for the COMMON case —
  KEEP EVERY CLIP, drop nothing — straight from the rough cut's own outputs. No CapCut draft
  required. (The hook-excision case, which drops the opening clip on purpose, is not this tool's job.)

SCHEMA PRODUCED (exactly what build-hf-captions.py consumes)
  {
    "total_s": <float>,                       # timeline length in seconds (inspection only)
    "beats": [                                # one beat per kept segment, in order
      {
        "clip":     <int>,                    # segment index
        "tl_start": <float>,                  # beat start on the final-cut timeline (seconds)
        "tl_end":   <float>,                  # beat end on the final-cut timeline (seconds)
        "scale":    1.0,                      # no zoom info in a plain cut -> 1.0
        "text":     <str>,                    # the beat's spoken text (readability)
        "words": [ {"w": <str>, "t": <float>, "e": <float>}, ... ]   # per-word TIMELINE timings
      }, ...
    ]
  }
  build-hf-captions.py only ever reads beats[*].words[*] as {w, t, e} (it flattens every beat's
  words and sorts by t). "w" keeps original casing + punctuation (the caption engine lowercases
  and strips punctuation itself, and splits sentences on trailing . ! ?). t/e are seconds on the
  final-cut timeline — i.e. positions in the exported video the caption overlay sits on top of.

SOURCES (rough-cut outputs)
  projects/<job>/transcript/cuts.json            — the kept segments, in order. Their durations,
                                                   summed, define each beat's [tl_start, tl_end].
  projects/<job>/outputs/<job>.transcript.json   — the DERIVED transcript: the kept words already
                                                   re-based to the final-cut timeline. This is the
                                                   authoritative word-timing source and is preferred.
  projects/<job>/transcript/words.json           — FALLBACK only (raw WhisperX word timings in
                                                   source-clip time). If the derived transcript is
                                                   missing, words are re-based per segment the same
                                                   way the hook-excision tool did.
