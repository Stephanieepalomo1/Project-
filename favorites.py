"""favorites.py — read the creator's favorites project in CapCut and make it the engine's taste.

The favorites project (spec: product/FAVORITES-PROJECT.md) is a CapCut project that is not a reel. It is a
shelf: she drops in the things she likes and the engine reads it. Adjectives do not survive the trip to a
builder ("high class", "punchy"); examples do. A creator who cannot describe her taste can always point at it.

BUILT: the SOUND half. Every sound on the shelf is copied into `_local/sounds/` and becomes part of the
engine's sound library, outranking the bundled set (capcut_sfx.palette() scans it last, so hers win). Her
"don'ts" (vary these, never the same one twice in a row, no whooshes on serious reels) are saved with them.
ALSO BUILT: `learn-style` — read a finished CapCut project she LOVES (not her shelf) and fold its taste in:
the text animations she used become the default in/out on hooks and other text in CapCut builds
(cleanyap / superyap `add_text`, when the reel's own plan names none), how busy its sound is becomes her
`sfx.density`, and its fonts + colors are reported so she can save them as a pack. Her sounds shelf is never
touched by it. Type sizes are reported, not applied (CapCut's stored size is not the builder's size unit).

`_local/` is protected by the updater and never ships, so her shelf survives every update.

  python3 product/favorites.py list                         # CapCut projects that hold sounds, newest first
  python3 product/favorites.py learn "my sound palette"     # read that project's sounds (re-run as it grows)
  python3 product/favorites.py learn "my sound palette" --rule "never the same sound twice in a row"
  python3 product/favorites.py rule "no whooshes on serious reels"   # add a don't later
  python3 product/favorites.py show                         # what the engine is using now (read this before choosing sounds)
  python3 product/favorites.py forget-rule 2                # drop one rule by its number in `show`
  python3 product/favorites.py forget                       # drop the whole shelf, sounds + rules (her CapCut project
                                                            # is untouched; a learned style stays until forget-style)
  python3 product/favorites.py learn-style "my best reel"   # fold in the style of a reel she loves
  python3 product/favorites.py forget-style                 # stop using it

Reading only. It never writes to CapCut, so CapCut can stay open.
Precedence, lowest to highest: bundled sounds -> her favorites -> what she asks for on THIS reel. The mood
rules still win over all of it: a somber reel gets no sound even when her shelf is full.
