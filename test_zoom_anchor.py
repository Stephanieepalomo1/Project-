"""test_zoom_anchor.py — regression guard for FACE-ANCHORED ZOOMS.

The bug this locks down (first PC test reel, 2026-09-17): every zoom was anchored to the FRAME
CENTRE. `product/capcut_motion.py` wrote clip.scale and never clip.transform; `product/build-reel-mp4.py`
cropped at `(zw - W) // 2`. A creator who does not sit dead centre therefore got enlarged-middle-of-the-
room and slid toward the edge on every push-in — reported as "the zooms go off to the side", and the
single worst creative complaint of that build. Her measured face sat at x=0.62 and moved 0.14 of the
frame width between takes, which is also why ONE anchor for the whole reel is not a fix.

Run:  python3 product/tests/test_zoom_anchor.py
