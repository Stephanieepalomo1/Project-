"""subject_place.py — hand the CapCut route a MEASURED y instead of a guessed one, and catch it when
something still lands on her. Shared by every format (Clean Yap / Super Yap / VO), never copy-pasted.

## Why this exists

On the rendered routes a composition is measured and gated. On the CapCut route there is no DOM to measure:
`add_text(..., x, y, ...)` takes a bare number and writes it straight into the draft. Those numbers were
picked by eye and copied between jobs — hooks went in at transform_y 0.60 / 0.62 / 0.74 across builds with
nothing behind the choice. CapCut's transform is in HALF-CANVAS units (pyJianYingDraft: "单位为半个画布宽"),
so 0.60 is y384 on a 1920-tall frame: comfortably clear of a subject framed low, and directly on the
forehead of one framed high. Same number, same code, opposite result, and no way for anyone to tell which
they were getting. A creator reported the second case repeatedly and was told it would be remembered.

So: `y_for()` turns a measured open zone into the number, and `check_draft()` refuses to let a build finish
with type sitting on her. Neither asks anyone to remember anything.

## Units

  transform_y = (960 - y_px) / 960   on the 1080x1920 authoring frame: +1.0 is the top edge, 0 the centre,
  -1.0 the bottom. Positive is UP, which is the opposite of the px axis and the reason this conversion has
  a home instead of being written out per build.

    reel's instruction outranks a standing preference. The NUMBER is always measured from THIS footage

    higher" is safe to remember and a y value never is.
