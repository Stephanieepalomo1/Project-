"""Stage the Hands-Off templates' restricted display fonts from the buyer's OWN CapCut, at render time.

WHY THIS EXISTS
The Hands-Off lane renders a finished MP4 in HyperFrames (a headless browser), so its frame templates
(product/creative-vault/hands-off/<pack>/index.html) load fonts via relative @font-face, e.g.
    @font-face{font-family:Soup;src:url('soup.ttf');}
Those display fonts (Soup Du Jour, Ugly Dave, Prosecco) are LICENSED and are NOT shipped — exactly like
the rest of the engine, which never distributes a licensed font and instead resolves it from the buyer's
CapCut (CapCut Pro carries them). This helper closes that loop for the Hands-Off render: it resolves each
restricted font BY NAME from CapCut's userFontData (via capcut_userfonts.py) and copies the file into the
pack's Hands-Off dir under the exact filename the template's @font-face expects. The template is untouched;
only the file appears, sourced from the buyer's machine.

Free/OFL fonts the templates also use (Noto, Playfair, Poppins, Inter) DO ship and need no staging.

USAGE
    python3 product/stage_hands_off_fonts.py                 # stage every pack that has restricted fonts
    python3 product/stage_hands_off_fonts.py playful         # just one pack
Run it once before a Hands-Off render. Idempotent: a font already present is left alone. If a restricted
font isn't in the buyer's CapCut, it's reported (they add it in CapCut Pro once, then re-run) — the render
would otherwise fall back to a system serif for that face.

Returns exit 0 when every restricted font for the requested pack(s) is present, 2 if any is still missing.
