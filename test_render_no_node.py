"""test_render_no_node.py — when the check cannot run, the render gate says so and never blames the composition.

reel_render.py runs HyperFrames' check through npx. On Windows that is `cmd /c npx ...`, and `cmd` always
exists, so with Node missing (most often: installed, but Git Bash not reopened since) nothing raised: the
check came back as an ordinary exit 1 and the gate said "check found issues ... Fix the composition". The
gate now asks for npx first (npx.cmd on Windows) and says plainly that Node is missing or the terminal needs
reopening, exit 4, in the same words product/reel_gate.py uses. The same holds when npx is there but could
not start HyperFrames at all (npm prints its own "npm error code ..." and HyperFrames never gives a
verdict). A real failed check (HyperFrames' own "Check failed") is reported exactly as before.
