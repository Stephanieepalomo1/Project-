# _path-shim.sh — source this before calling any external tool from a shell script.
#
# WHY: on Windows almost nothing the engine depends on is on PATH in a fresh shell. node, npx, npm,
# ffmpeg, ffprobe, uv and git all install to their own folders, and whether those folders reach PATH
# depends on the installer, the shell, and whether the terminal was reopened afterwards. Measured on
# Windows: the same directories had to be prepended by hand before nearly every command, and were lost
# again on the next one, because a shell's PATH does not outlive the shell.
#
# This repairs PATH for THIS PROCESS ONLY. It writes nothing to the machine, needs no admin rights,
# and cannot leave a buyer's system changed. Reopening the terminal simply re-runs it.
#
# A directory is added only when the tool is genuinely missing, so a correctly-configured machine is
# untouched. (Unlike the python3 shim this tests PRESENCE, not execution — see the note below.)
#
# Harmless on macOS, where it also covers the real case of Homebrew not being on PATH in a
# non-login shell (a fresh-Mac snag that looks identical to the buyer: "command not found").
#
# ~/.local/bin is now listed for every tool, not just uv. On a true Intel Mac, where Homebrew cannot
# be installed at all, that directory is where EVERYTHING lands (see product/INTEL-MAC-ROUTE.md) —
# static ffmpeg/ffprobe, uv, and uv's python3 shims. It used to be listed for uv alone, so on that
# machine a correct install still reported ffmpeg and python3 as missing, which is the single most
# demoralising failure shape there is: you did everything right and the checker says you did not.

# Presence check only — deliberately NOT an execution test.
#
# The python3 shim runs the tool because Windows ships a DECOY at that exact name. No such decoy
# exists for node/ffmpeg/uv/git, so here `command -v` is enough, and it is enough by a wide margin:
# executing seven tools to ask their version cost ~440 ms on EVERY script start (splice, transcribe,
# smoke-test), paid by every creator on every run, to re-confirm a healthy machine. This is ~2 ms.
# Version-flag spellings also differ (ffmpeg wants -version, not --version), so an execution test
# here reported a perfectly good ffmpeg as missing.
_ps_have() { command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1; }

# Convert a Windows-style path to the POSIX form this shell uses.
#
# THIS IS LOAD-BEARING. On Git Bash the Windows environment variables are Windows-style and carry a DRIVE
# COLON: $LOCALAPPDATA is "C:\Users\her\AppData\Local". PATH is colon-separated, so prepending one of
# those raw splits it in half and leaves a junk "C" entry plus an unusable remainder — PATH is corrupted
# from that line on, and every tool lookup in the rest of the script fails. The symptom is not an error
# message, it is the engine quietly losing the ability to find its own tools.

# The shim previously looked at WinGet/Links (which winget had left EMPTY on that machine) and at
# Programs/nodejs (one folder shallower than where node actually was), so it found neither.
#
# The path is converted to POSIX form BEFORE globbing: a Windows-style string with a drive colon and
# backslashes matches nothing, so globbing first would silently return zero hits on every machine.
