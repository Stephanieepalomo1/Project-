"""Guard: scripts/name-final.sh promotes the right pass, never deletes a clean cut, and never loses a final.

Each case builds a throwaway engine folder (a copy of name-final.sh and the path shim, plus one job's outputs/)
and runs `name-final.sh <job> --apply` there, so the real projects/ and Downloads are never touched.

What broke, one case each:
  - a job name holding "final" or "draft" (final-cut, draft-day, first-draft-tips) made every pass look final
    or like a draft: draft-day promoted a stranger's file, final-cut kept every pass it should have cleared
  - a job folder renamed after its cut (_kajabi holding kajabi.mp4 + kajabi.transcript.json) had its clean cut
    deleted as a leftover, and a job name holding [ ] made find treat it as a pattern and do the same
  - a newer pass replaced an existing <job>.final.mp4 with no copy kept
  - a short preview (an 11-second cold open, a 6-second hook test) was promoted as "the reel"
